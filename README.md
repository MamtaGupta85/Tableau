## Electric Vehicle Data Analysis

# KEY OBJECTIVES:

As per the latest reports, it is been estimated that the Electric car market around the world will grow from USD 396.4 billion in 2024 to around 620 billion USD in 2030, showcasing a 7.7% CAGR. The high growth potential of EV market makes it a lucrative source of business as the world becoming concious of the degrading affects of the petroleum driven cars. Because of these reasons, it becomes important to study and understand the underlying trends and patterns in EV market. This is what I have tried to achieve through this dynamic dashboard as well. The dashboard aims to figure out how many total EV vehicles are already running on streets and how the total market is being acquired within its market players. Furthermore, it attempts to figure out the past decadal trend, on the basis of which we tried to understand if the reports hold true to our analysis as well. In short, the objective of this dashboard is to understand the EV market sales and trends through its every aspect.
