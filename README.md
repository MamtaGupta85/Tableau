# PROJECTS AND THEIR EXPLANATION:

## 1) Electric Vehicle Data Analysis

As per the latest reports, it is estimated that the Electric car market around the world will grow from USD 396.4 billion in 2024 to around 620 billion USD in 2030, showcasing a 7.7% CAGR. This high growth potential of EV market makes it a lucrative source of business as the world started to become conscious of the degrading affects of the petroleum driven cars. Because of these reasons, it becomes important to study and understand the underlying trends and patterns in EV market. This is what I have tried to achieve through this dynamic dashboard as well. 

### KEY OBJECTIVES:
The dashboard aims to figure out how many total EV vehicles are already running on streets and how the total market is being acquired within its market players. Through the analysis, attempts are being made to reveal how EV sales are concenterated in different regions of USA or which company and their model is dominating the market. Furthermore, it attempts to figure out the past decadal trend, on the basis of which we tried to understand if the reports hold true to our analysis as well. In short, the objective of this dashboard is to understand the EV market sales and trends through its every aspect.

### KEY INSIGHTS: 

1) The first key takeaway was that around 150k EV vehicles have been already in the market, out of which 77.6% EV vehicles were battery electric vehicles (BEV) whereas rest 22.4% were plug-in electric vehicles. Through this distribution, it can be said that maximum of the EV users prefers Battery electric vehicles which in turn helps to meet the desired motive behind the launch of EV, which is reduction in consumption of petroleum based vehicles.
   
2)  Upon examining the decadal trend of the number of EV in market, it is being found that EV market showed an increasing trend between 2011-2023 except the years 2019-2020 when COVID hit the market and we saw a sharp decline in the sales. As we draw an average refrence line, the average EV sales turned out to be 10.7k. This refrence line showcased that before 2018, the EV sales were always below the average whereas but after 2018, the sales stood above average with 2023 seeing the highest spike. However, we can see that although in the years 2019-2020 stood above average, these two years saw a decline because of covid but thereafter, the EV sales saw huge increase which we can attribute to the fact of shifting perceptions of using more environmental friendly vehicles.

3) Distribution of EV vehicles amongst different US states revealed that WA (Washington) has the maximum number of EV, around 150k as opposed to all other states. This shows that residents of WA has maximum likelihood to purchase EV than a normal car.

4) It is found that amongst the top 10 vehicles by companies, tesla is dominating the EV market clinching around half of the market share i.e. 52.70%. Whereas the rest portion of market is divided into small shares by many competitors, like NISSAN having 10.32% share, CHEVROLET 9.19% and so on. This showed that tesla has already built a strong position in the EV market, gained large customer base and their confidence, making it quite difficult for the new players to enter the market.

5) A Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) is a vehicle that meets certain fuel and electric-only range requirements as defined by House Bill 2042. Examining the EV market as per CAFV eligibility, it is revealed that 46.34% of the total EV vehicles fell under CAFV eligibility unknown, followed by 41.81% of total EV are CAFV eligible and the rest 11.85% are CAFV not eligible.

6) Through the tabular analysis, it is found that the maximum models that were sold were of BEV as compared to PHEV and these are all TESLA produced BEV which showed the highest number of vehicles. This again showed the continued dominance of TESLA in EV market.

### WAY FORWARD

1) To furthen the analysis, it is required that data collection encompasses study of the factors which directly impacts the sales of EV like availability of charging station, time taken to charge the vehicle.
2) It is no hidden that every buyer cares about the cost of their new vehicles. A recent study showed 67% of would-be purchasers claim cost is a primary concern. This is one of those aspects of EV adoption that has additional, external factors playing a role. While the cost of producing EVs is expected to drop, until manufacturers believe EVs will sell at comparable rates to ICE vehicles, the upfront cost will likely remain higher. The above study didn't take into account the prices of the models, which could have further revealed if the EV customers are price sensitive or not. Therefore, to broaden the scope of analysis, it is required that data is collected about prices as well.
3) The EV industry takes manufacturing costs as one of the important considerations when developing and producing vehicles as it allows them to understand if the production will bring economies of scale to them. Lack of this factor in the analysis takes away the opportunity to figure out current situation about manufacturing costs in EV market.
